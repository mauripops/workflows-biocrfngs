| Table of differential expression results for each gene calculated with DESeq2. Genes closer to the top are more significantly differentially expressed.
|
| This file shows the differential expression results for the contrast group {{ snakemake.wildcards.contrast }}. The log2FoldChange values represent log2 ( {{ snakemake.params.contrast[0] }} / {{ snakemake.params.contrast[1] }} ).
